# Arrythmia_Detection
This repo contains files which are necessary to implement the use case 'Arrythmia Detection' referenced by the paper 'Arrhythmia Detection using MIT-BIH Dataset : A
Review' and the dataset could be cloned or downloaded from the hereby mentioned link:
'https://physionet.org/content/mitdb/1.0.0/'

The neural architectural models used for implementing the use case are Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) and then in order to get an improved accuracy score , the model later is implemented as Convolutional Neural Network added along with LSTM model (CNN-LSTM).

The files present in the repo are as follows:

1. Python Notebook implementing the 'Arrythmia Detection'.
2. Python clone file for the same above notebook.
3. Research Paper referenced for implementing the use-case.
